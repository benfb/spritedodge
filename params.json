{"name":"Spritedodge","tagline":"A simple game made with Ruby.","body":"## About\r\n\r\nAn incredibly simple attempt at a first game in Ruby. Some things are still not working, but it's no longer in development. Feel free to contribute or use it as a tutorial for making your own, however.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nClone the repository and install the `gosu` gem. Run `ruby Main.rb` to play.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nMove left and right with the arrow keys. Avoid the rocks, collect the gems. Hit P to pause the game, Space to continue after hitting something, R to restart the entire game, and Q to quit.\r\n\r\nAlso, the game chooses at random from five backgrounds and three songs each time you start it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* \"CuteGod\" art by Daniel Cook (Lostgarden.com) \r\n\r\n* Music from the artists PeterGMusic, Calamalstr, and 15thDimension on Newgrounds.\r\n\r\n* Sound effects from the free archive at the Absolute Sound Effects Archive.\r\n\r\n* Font from Kimberly Geswein on dafont.\r\n\r\n* All code written by Ben Bailey.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
