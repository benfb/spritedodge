## About

An incredibly simple attempt at a first game in Ruby. Some things are still not working, but it's no longer in development. Feel free to contribute or use it as a tutorial for making your own, however.

## Install
Clone the repository and install the `gosu` gem. Run `ruby Main.rb` to play.

## Instructions

Move left and right with the arrow keys. Avoid the rocks, collect the gems. Hit P to pause the game, Space to continue after hitting something, R to restart the entire game, and Q to quit.

Also, the game chooses at random from five backgrounds and three songs each time you start it. Enjoy!
